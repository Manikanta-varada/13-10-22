Virat Kohli was born on 5 November 1988 in New Delhi into a Punjabi Hindu family.[17] His father, Prem Kohli, worked as a criminal lawyer and his mother, Saroj Kohli, is a homemaker.[18][19] He has an older brother, Vikash, and an older sister, Bhavna.[20]

Kohli was raised in Uttam Nagar[21] and started his schooling at Vishal Bharti Public School.[18][22] In 1998, the West Delhi Cricket Academy was created and a nine-year-old Kohli was part of its first intake.[21] Kohli trained at the academy under Rajkumar Sharma[19] and also played matches at the Sumeet Dogra Academy at Vasundhara Enclave at the same time.[21] In ninth grade, he shifted to Saviour Convent in Paschim Vihar to help his cricket practice.[18][23] His family lived in Meera Bagh until 2015 when they moved to Gurgaon.[24]

Kohli's father died on 18 December 2006 due to a stroke after being bed-ridden for a month.[18]

Delhi
Kohli first played for Delhi Under-15 team in October 2002 in the 2002–03 Polly Umrigar Trophy. He became the captain of the team for the 2003–04 Polly Umrigar Trophy. In late 2004, he was selected in the Delhi Under-17 team for the 2003–04 Vijay Merchant Trophy. Delhi Under-17s won the 2004–05 Vijay Merchant Trophy in which Kohli finished as the highest run-scorer with 757 runs from 7 matches with two centuries.[25] In February 2006, he made his List A debut for Delhi against Services but did not get to bat.[26]

Kohli made his first-class debut for Delhi against Tamil Nadu[27] in November 2006, at the age of 18, he scored 10 runs in his debut innings.[28] He came into the spotlight in December when he decided to play for his team against Karnataka on the day after his father's death and went on to score 90.[29] He went directly to the funeral after he got out in the match. He scored a total of 257 runs from 6 matches at an average of 36.71 in that season.[30]

India Under-19
In July 2006, Kohli was selected in the India Under-19 squad on its tour of England. He averaged 105 in the three-match ODI series against England Under-19s[31] and 49 in the three-match Test series.[32] India Under-19 went on to win both the series. In September, the India Under-19 team toured Pakistan. Kohli averaged 58 in the Test series[33] and 41.66 in the ODI series against Pakistan Under-19s.[34]

In April 2007, he made his Twenty20 debut[35] and finished as the highest run-getter for his team in the Inter-State T20 Championship with 179 runs at an average of 35.80.[36] In July–August 2007, the India Under-19 team toured Sri Lanka. In the triangular series against Sri Lanka Under-19s and Bangladesh Under-19s, Kohli was the second highest run-getter with 146 runs at an average of 29 from 5 matches.[37][38] In the two-match Test series that followed, he scored 244 runs at an average of 122 including a century and a fifty.[39]

In February–March 2008, Kohli captained the victorious Indian team at the 2008 Under-19 Cricket World Cup held in Malaysia. Batting at number 3, he scored 235 runs in 6 matches at an average of 47 and finished as the tournament's third-highest run-getter and one of the three batsmen to score a hundred in the tournament.[40][41] He has helped India in a three-wicket semi-final win over New Zealand Under-19s by taking 2 wickets and scoring 43 runs in the run-chase and was awarded the man of the match.[42][43]

In June 2008, Kohli and his Under-19 teammates Pradeep Sangwan and Tanmay Srivastava were awarded the Border-Gavaskar scholarship. The scholarship allowed the three players to train for six weeks at Cricket Australia's Centre of Excellence in Brisbane.[41] He was also picked in the India Emerging Players squad for the four-team Emerging Players Tournament and scored 206 runs in six matches at an average of 41.20.[44]

International career
Early years
In August 2008, Kohli was included in the Indian ODI squad for tour of Sri Lanka and the Champions Trophy in Pakistan. Prior to the Sri Lankan tour, Kohli had played only eight List A matches.[45] So, his selection was called a "surprise call-up".[46] During the Sri Lankan tour, as both first-choice openers Sachin Tendulkar and Virender Sehwag were injured, Kohli batted as a makeshift opener throughout the series.[47] He made his international debut, at the age of 19, in the first ODI of the tour and was dismissed for 12.[48] He made his first ODI half century, a score of 54, in the fourth match.[48] He had scores of 37, 25 and 31 in the other three matches.[48] India won the series 3–2 which was India's first ODI series win against Sri Lanka in Sri Lanka.[49][50]

After the postponement of Champions Trophy to 2009, Kohli was picked as a replacement for the injured Shikhar Dhawan in the India A squad for the unofficial Tests against Australia A in September 2008.[51] He batted only once in the two-match series, and scored 49 in that innings.[52] Later that month in September 2008, he played for Delhi in the Nissar Trophy against SNGPL (winners of Quaid-i-Azam Trophy from Pakistan) and top-scored for Delhi in both innings, with 52 and 197.[53][54] The match was drawn but SNGPL won the trophy on first-innings lead.[54] In October 2008, Kohli played for Indian Board President's XI in a four-day tour match against Australia.[55]

Kohli, after recovering from a minor shoulder injury, returned to the national team replacing the injured Gautam Gambhir in the Indian squad for the tri-series in Sri Lanka.[56] He batted at number 4 for India in the 2009 ICC Champions Trophy because of an injury to Yuvraj Singh.[57] In the group match against the West Indies, Kohli scored an unbeaten 79 in India's successful chase of 130 and was awarded man of the match award.[58] Kohli played as a reserve batsman in the seven-match home ODI series against Australia, appearing in two matches.[59] He found a place in the home ODI series against Sri Lanka in December 2009 and scored 27[60] and 54 in the first two ODIs before making way for Yuvraj who regained fitness for the third ODI. However, Yuvraj's finger injury recurred leading to him being ruled out indefinitely.[61][62] Kohli returned to the team in the fourth ODI at Kolkata and scored his first ODI century–107 off 114 balls–sharing a 224-run partnership for the third wicket with Gambhir, who made his personal best score of 150.[48][63] India won by seven wickets to seal the series 3–1.[48] The man of the match was awarded to Gambhir who gave the award to Kohli.[63]

Tendulkar was rested for the tri-nation ODI tournament in Bangladesh in January 2010,[64] which enabled Kohli to play in each of India's five matches.[65] Against Bangladesh, he scored 91 to help secure a win after India collapsed to 51/3 early in their run-chase of 297.[48][66] In the next match against Sri Lanka, Kohli ended unbeaten on 71 to help India win the match with a bonus point having chased down their target of 214 within 33 overs.[67] The next day, he scored his second ODI century, against Bangladesh, bringing up the mark with the winning runs.[68] He became only the third Indian batsman to score two ODI centuries before their 22nd birthday, after Tendulkar and Suresh Raina.[69] Kohli was much praised for his performances during the series[70][71] in particular by the Indian captain Dhoni.[72] Although Kohli made only two runs in the final against Sri Lanka in a four-wicket Indian defeat,[73] he finished as the leading run-getter of the series with 275 runs from five innings at an average of 91.66.[74] In the three-match ODI series at home against South Africa in February, Kohli batted in two games and had scores of 31 and 57.[48]
